# Camunda React

This project contains a simple UI written in ReactJs that can be used to demonstrate how to start a Camunda Process Instance and how to view User Tasks.

### Quick Start

See the https://github.com/camunda-consulting/camunda-demo-starter[`camunda-demo-starter`] project to quickly start a fully functional Camunda 7 or 8 demo environment that includes this project.

### Development

This project is a Spring Boot Java Application that runs a ReactJs web application. This makes it possible to take advantage of Spring Security and other Spring goodies.

Clone this project (the `camunda-demo-ui` project) to your local machine

 git clone https://github.com/camunda-consulting/camunda-demo-ui

The `camunda-demo-ui` directory contains the relevant files for this project.

Once you have the code, use maven to compile both the ReactJs App and Spring Boot

 cd camunda-demo-ui
 mvn clean spring-boot:run

NOTE: The app will be available on port 8080

  http://localhost:8080

The Maven build will perform the following:

* Install the correct versions of NPM and Node
* Create the node_modules directory with the necessary dependencies
* Use Webpack to build/transpile the JSX files into a bundle.js javascript file
* Copy `bundle.js` into `src/main/resources/static/built`
* Build the Spring Boot Application that uses Thymeleaf to serve the ReactJS UI

#### More Details about the Spring Boot Project

* Thymeleaf is a spring project for UI templating. It looks in the `src/main/resources/templates` directory for a `.html` file to serve.
* A Spring Controller is configured to serve the HTML on a specific context path. See the controller `src/main/java/com/camunda/poc/starter/controller/ui/UiApplicationController.java`

### Configure the camunda-data-api endpoint

This project relies on the `camunda-data-api` project to provide a backend api where the React app gets data.

In the .env file in the project home directory change the environment variables to match the spring-boot server context for the data-api.

NOTE: The connection to the demo data api is configured in .env

  DATA_API=http://127.0.0.1:9000/api

WARNING: CORS is disabled by default with SimpleSecurityFilter.java

### Docker Compose

When demoing or distributing it makes sense to build this project with docker-compose. When you follow the "Quick Start" steps in the camunda-demo-starter project, the docker image is already built and deployed as a GitHub Package. But, if you are customizing this project, you can also run the docker-compose command like so:

```
 docker-compose -f docker-compose.ui.yml up -d --build reactjs
```

### Developing with NodeJs

Even though everything can be built using `mvn`, it's often convenient to use `npm` and `webpack` to run the ReactJs webapp so that it's possible to update react javascript files and then refresh the browser to see the changes in real time.

* Run or just build the spring-boot project with either command. This will install all node, npm and the dependencies

  mvn clean spring-boot:run

  or

  mvn clean install -DskipTests

* Start a node server process

 npm run live

* Start another terminal and start a `webpack` process

 npm run watch

* Confirm the `node` and `webpack` processes are up and running.

** Browse to http://localhost:3000/app.html and ensure that the form is displayed.
** Make a change to `/src/main/js/reactjs/app.jsx`. Wait for webpack to build the new `bundle.js`, then refresh the browser and make sure you see your changes.

#### More Details about Javascript Environment

* The Javascript/JSX files of interest are in the `src/main/js` folder.
* The files in `src/main/js/reactjs/application/components` are reusable components.
* The files in `src/main/js/reactjs/application/usecase` are use case specific components
* The file `src/main/js/reactjs/application/app.jsx` is the entry point to the application.

### Add new single page app

This project is organized to make it easy to add new single page web apps. Each app can reuse shared components as
needed. Create a new app in 3 steps:

1. Create a new "entrypoint" jsx file. Entry point components typically render a main React component into a html page. For example, `src/main/js/reactjs/application/login.jsx` mounts a `<Login/>` react component.
2. Update the `webpack.config.js` to produce a bundle js file for the entrypoint. For example, the following snippet tells webpack to transpile `login.jsx` (and all of it's transitive dependencies). The result will be a javascript file named `login.bundle.js` inside the `src/main/resources/static/built` directory.

```
  entry: {
    ...
    login: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/main/js/reactjs/application/login.jsx'),
    ...
  },
```
3. Use the javascript file from an html file. For example, `src/main/resources/templates/login.html` simply includes the `login.bundle.js` file like so:

```html
    <div id="react"></div>
    <script src="built/login.bundle.js"></script>
```
